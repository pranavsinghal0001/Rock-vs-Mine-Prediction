# Rock vs Mine Prediction ⚒️⛏️

## Overview
This project is a **Rock vs Mine Prediction** model implemented in Python using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine** based on their characteristics.

## 📂 Dataset
The model is trained on a sonar dataset that contains frequency responses of objects detected using sonar signals.

## 📌 Features Used
- 📡 Sonar Signal Frequency
- 🔊 Signal Intensity
- 📈 Waveform Characteristics
- 🏗️ Reflection Patterns

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📒 Jupyter Notebook
- 🏗️ Pandas
- 🔢 NumPy
- 🤖 Scikit-Learn
- 📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 🚀 Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
   cd rock-vs-mine-prediction
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run **Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 🏆 Model Training & Evaluation
- The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and normalizing features.
- Various ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are trained and evaluated.
- Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📈 Results
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **76%**.
- Feature importance analysis was conducted to understand significant predictors.
